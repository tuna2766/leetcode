# 997. Find the Town Judge

In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties **1** and **2**.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that the person labeled `ai` trusts the person labeled `bi`.

Return *the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return* `-1` *otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= trust.length <= 104`
- `trust[i].length == 2`
- All the pairs of `trust` are **unique**.
- `ai != bi`
- `1 <= ai, bi <= n`

        int u = trust.size();

            G[trust[i][0]].push_back(trust[i][1]);
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        int judgeNum = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if(G[i].size() == 0) {  
                for(int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
                    bool hasJudge = false;
                    for(int y = 0; y < G[x].size(); y++)
                        if(G[x][y] == i) hasJudge = true;
                    if(!hasJudge && x != i) return -1;
                }
                ans = i;
                judgeNum++;
            }
        }
        if(judgeNum > 1) return -1;
        if(judgeNum == 0) return -1;
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

解法:

1. 判斷入度為0
2. 判斷所有點(除了judge自身)都相鄰judge
3. judge只能有一個
